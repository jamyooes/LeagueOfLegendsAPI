Day 1: 1/8/2025

What did I do?
Research about League API

Thoughts?
I want to mostly do stuff around champions and items as opposed to summoners
Not a bad start, mostly trying to understand how everything works
My naming is very terrible

Expectations for this project:
-Mostly play around with data. 
-I want to mostly focus on champion data
-I want to mostly look into combos and dmg done and the effects with items
-I want to figure out the math behind the game and any optimizations that can be done
-Champion stats in the game are probably going to be a second thought
-Maybe in the future movement speed math??
