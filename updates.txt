Day 2: 1/9/2025
What did I do?
Created a class for champion Data
Trying to figure out what parts are useful and what parts are not useful 

Thoughts?
I am realizing that it is becoming more and more complicated now that I am thinking about this 
application
Need to consider HP, Runes ticking, Time, item and time etc..
I think it is better for simplicity to stick to 1 v 1 pure laning.

Day 1: 1/8/2025

What did I do?
Research about League API

Thoughts?
I want to mostly do stuff around champions and items as opposed to summoners
Not a bad start, mostly trying to understand how everything works
My naming is very terrible

Expectations for this project:
-Mostly play around with data. 
-I want to mostly focus on champion data
-I want to mostly look into combos and dmg done and the effects with items
-I want to figure out the math behind the game and any optimizations that can be done
-Champion stats in the game are probably going to be a second thought
-Maybe in the future movement speed math??
